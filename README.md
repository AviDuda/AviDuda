### Here be raccoons 🦝

Howdy! I'm Avi (they/them), a raccoon around games for over 10 years.

🧑‍💻 I'm currently a web developer for [GameDiscoverCo](https://gamediscover.co/). Mostly frontend React stuff, but helping however I can.

I know a bunch of stuff about different areas.

📈 **Experience**

- 🕸️ Development
  - JS ecosystem: React, Svelte, AngularJS. I really enjoy tuning up ESLint configs, rewriting codebases to TypeScript, and other productivity-related things!
  - PHP
  - Databases
  - DevOps: Docker, Ansible, Linux, Google Cloud
- 🎮 Game dev stuff
  - Shipped 100 DLCs for Euro Truck Simulator 2 + American Truck Simulator
  - PR/marketing
  - Business development
  - Game production
  - Organizing Steam sales: [Czech & Slovak Games Week](https://gamesweek.net/en/)

🌱 **I like learning** about various things. I'm very excited about technologies like [Remix](https://remix.run/) which simplify life of developers.  

🤬 **Fuck** capitalism and TERFs. 🏳️‍⚧️

✨ **Favorites:** VS Code, remote containers, you.

📫 **How to reach me**: NOT by email. If you use my GitHub commit emails, *I'll strangle you*. If you are a recruiter, then I'm probably not interested, but here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aviduda/).
